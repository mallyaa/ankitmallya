## Ankit Mallya

**Engineering @ BetaNXT** · Engineering → Product

### Summary

I’m a product-minded engineer transitioning into Technical Product Management, with a strong foundation in cloud and data platforms (AWS, Snowflake, dbt) and a track record of building scalable systems that deliver real business and customer impact.

I operate at the intersection of engineering depth, product strategy, and execution — turning ambiguous problems into clear product narratives, structured roadmaps, and high-quality launches. I enjoy simplifying complexity, aligning stakeholders, and driving outcomes from discovery through delivery.

My strengths include:

- Problem discovery & customer empathy (asking the right questions before building)
- Prioritization & roadmap clarity (balancing impact, effort, and risk)
- Data platform and cloud expertise (AWS, Snowflake, dbt, automation workflows)
- Execution leadership (shipping reliable systems, improving efficiency, and reducing manual work)

I’m especially interested in platform, data, and infrastructure-adjacent product roles, where deep technical context meets high-leverage product thinking — building tools and systems that make teams faster, decisions smarter, and businesses stronger.

Outside of work, you’ll usually find me stress-watching Manchester United, backing my favorite UFC fighter like it’s a personal responsibility, or in the gym pretending my discipline is consistent.

### Experience highlights

- **Data & pipelines** — Production-grade ingestion and transformation (AWS, Snowflake, dbt).
- **Automation** — Improved delivery speed and reduced operational toil.
- **AI enablement** — LLMs, RAG, intelligent data access.
